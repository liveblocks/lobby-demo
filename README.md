# Early lobby concept demo by Liveblocks

This project illustrates the Lobby room concept that we're currently prototyping and
testing out. **The implementation in this repo is currently FAKE, and just exists to get a
feel for what the eventual API would be like.**

## See it live

See it live on https://liveblocks-lobby-demo.vercel.app/. To use it, open a bunch of tabs
on the same machine.

This fake implementation currently only works from a single machine.

## Work on it locally

First, install dependencies with `npm install`.

Then simply run `npm run dev` locally.
